  factorial.c

  Goal: compute 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * n using a while loop -- the
  multiplication twin of Day 8's summation loop.

  IMPORTANT CONTRAST: the summation loop started its accumulator
  (s) at 0, because 0 is the "do-nothing" value for addition (adding
  0 changes nothing). This loop's accumulator needs to start at a
  DIFFERENT value -- think about what number is the "do-nothing"
  value for MULTIPLICATION instead. If you start at 0 here, what
  happens to every single multiplication after that?

  Compile with:
      cc factorial_.c
  Run with:
      ./a.out

  Test case: n = 5  ->  1*2*3*4*5 = 120

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  double n, i, result;

    printf("Enter n: ");
    scanf("%lf", &n);

    // TODO 1: set up i and p before the loop. i should start at 1,
    //         same as the summation loop. But think carefully about
    //         what p should start at -- see the note above.

    i = 1;
    result = 1;
    
    // TODO 2: write a while loop that multiplies p by i, then
    //         increases i, once per pass, until i exceeds n:

    while (i <= n) {
      result = result * i;
      i = i + 1;
      
    }
    
    printf("%lf\n", result);

    // BONUS
    // Repeat the above, but instead, implement n *n
    
    i = n;
    result = 1;

    while ( i <= n) {
      result = result * 1;
      i = i - 1;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
