  Goal: print a sports team's record as wins and losses, but:
    - if wins is 0, don't print anything about wins at all
    - if losses is 0, don't print anything about losses at all
    - use correct singular/plural ("1 win" vs "2 wins")
    - if BOTH wins and losses are printed, put exactly one space
      between them -- but if only ONE of them is printed, there
      should be no extra leading or trailing space

  This last part is the new, tricky idea: each piece is independent
  and OPTIONAL, but they still need to join together correctly no
  matter which combination of pieces actually gets printed.

  Compile with:
      cc game_record_skeleton.c
  Run with:
      ./a.out

  Test cases:
      wins=3, losses=2  -> "3 wins 2 losses"
      wins=1, losses=0  -> "1 win"
      wins=0, losses=1  -> "1 loss"
      wins=1, losses=1  -> "1 win 1 loss"

    //         else. This will track whether we've already printed
