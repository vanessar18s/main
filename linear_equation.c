  linear_equation.c

  Goal: solve the equation  b*x + c = 0  for x, where the user
  enters b and c. Normally x = -c/b -- but watch out for b = 0!

  If b is 0, the equation becomes just "c = 0", which has no x in
  it at all. Two cases:
    - if c is ALSO 0:  the equation is "0 = 0", true for every x
                        -> infinitely many solutions
    - if c is NOT 0:   the equation is something like "5 = 0",
                        which is never true -> no solution

  Compile with:
      cc day6_03_linear_equation.c
  Run with:
      ./a.out

  Test cases:
      b=2,  c=-4  -> x = 2.000000
      b=0,  c=0   -> infinitely many solutions
      b=0,  c=5   -> no solution

    printf("First enter number b than c:" );
    scanf("%lf %lf", &b, &c);
    
    // TODO 3: write the degenerate-case logic: check whether b is
    //         0 first. If it is, check whether c is also 0 to
    //         decide between "infinitely many solutions" and "no
    //         solution". Otherwise, solve normally for x.
