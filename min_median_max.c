  min_median_max.c

  Goal: given three numbers, IN ANY ORDER, figure out which one is
  the minimum, which is the median (middle), and which is the
  maximum -- without using arrays or sorting functions, just if's.

  This is a genuinely new kind of problem: so far every if-statement
  we've written has answered a yes/no question. This one has to
  figure out an ORDERING among three values.

  The trick: compare pairs of variables, and let each comparison
  narrow down what you know. There are only 6 possible orderings of
  three numbers, and a tree of nested if/else statements can cover
  all 6.

  Compile with:
      cc day6_04_min_median_max.c
  Run with:
      ./a.out

  Test cases:
      100 120 200  -> min=100 median=120 max=200
      100 170 200  -> min=100 median=170 max=200
      100 150 200  -> min=100 median=150 max=200
      200 100 170  -> min=100 median=170 max=200   (NOT in sorted order!)

    // TODO 3: figure out the ordering with nested ifs. Start by
    //         comparing a and b -- that splits the problem into two
    //         halves (a<=b, or b<a). Within EACH half, you then need
    //         to compare against c to finish sorting out the order.
    //         There are 6 possible orderings total; build a decision
    //         tree of nested if/else statements that covers all 6,
    //         assigning min, median, and max at each final branch.
